# ðŸ“‚ Java Collections and Streams

This module explores Javaâ€™s Collections Framework, Stream API, and complementary features like generics, annotations, and exception handling. It focuses on building efficient, readable, and type-safe code while solving real-world data processing problems.

Key topics include:

* Collections framework with List, Set, Map, and Queue for structured data storage and manipulation.
* Java 8 Streams and lambda expressions for functional-style operations like `filter`, `map`, `collect`, and `reduce`.
* Generics to enable type-safe and reusable classes, interfaces, and methods.
* Regular expressions (`regex`) for pattern matching and validation using `Pattern` and `Matcher`.
* Annotations such as `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, and custom annotations to enhance code semantics and tooling support.
* Exception handling practices using `try-catch`, custom exceptions, and `try-with-resources` for safe resource management.
